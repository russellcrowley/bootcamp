<h3> Bootcamp code </h3>

This is just a small selection of some of the code I've written:

- emailer.py - a simple function, using yagmail, that allows me to easily send an email within a python script
- image_downloader.py - takes a search term and a number, and downloads that number of images from imgur and saves it to your present directory
- menu.sh - it's not much (a very basic menu), but it's my first bash script! I also love figlet
- russ_alerts.pyw - a function to alert you if a text condition is matched on a website, and an amazon price scraper/watcher
- twint_script.sh - a bash scripte that uses twint to scrape twitter according to different conditions
- twint_script_installer.sh - a bash script that automates the installation of twint and its dependencies, then runs the above script
- weather_bulletin.py - a python function that uses the OpenWeather API to get weather data, parse the response and produce a report
